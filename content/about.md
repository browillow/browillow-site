**The BroWillow vlog is currently scheduled to launch on Monday, December 03, 2018**

My name is Jordan Osier, also known on the internet as **BroWillow**. I maintain a vlog on Facebook and YouTube for the purpose of publicly discussing my thoughts and questions in theology, philosophy, science, and politics. My videos are meant to challenge, educate, encourage civil discussion, and invite others to join me in my quest for truth. I post new videos **every Monday at 6:00 AM EST**.

I was born to American missionaries in Spain in the early nineties and lived there for eight years. After our family returned to the U.S., we eventually settled in the Tennessee valley where I spent the majority of my life from middle school up until graduating from college. My undergraduate program ended in 2014 with a Bachelors of Science in electrical engineering, moving to Virginia to marry my wife, and starting a career as a software engineer. Since then, I've mostly spent my spare time with my family, playing music and volunteering at my church, and waking up before dawn to work on my own ideas for building the next Facebook-level software company (and learning how difficult it is to do on your own).

As a new father, I've decided that the best thing I can do for my family is take the time necessary to study up on and understand our faith as deeply as possible, understand reality as accurately as possible in order to correctly teach and effectively protect my kids, and keep a pulse on the political state of our country and world so that I advocate for or oppose change as an informed citizen.

As I share my efforts through video, I hope others are encouraged to understand, give feedback, and disagree with me so that we can mutually benefit from each other. I can be reached through Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram.
