# Introduction

My name is Jordan Osier and I'd like to welcome you to the first post of the BroWillow vlog. I've decided to create a my own place to openly discuss my thoughts and learnings in areas where the truth isn't always cut and dry: theology, philosophy, science, and politics. By going on a public journey of research and discussion, I hope that my videos will help me organize my thoughts and benefit others if possible.

Let me briefly explain why I want to talk about these topics.

# Science

Science is a methodology by which we use observations of the world around us to make conclusions about reality. Scientific discoveries have helped us build faster computers, combat disease, and go to the moon. It’s all about asking questions, coming up with theories, running experiments, looking at the evidence, and forming conclusions.

However, even with a community of people that are supposed to be working together to build up our knowledge, there are still important questions that have very vocal groups of people promoting opposite answers. Here’s some examples:

  * Is it unhealthy to eat meat?
  * Is formula significantly inferior to breastfeeding?
  * Are human beings warming up the earth?
  * Is pineapple pizza an abomination to nature?

If you have a diverse enough social network, posting one of these questions will attract a barrage of opinions. People on both sides claiming that they have the facts straight. If you are a new parent like me who cares about the health of your baby girl and of yourself for that matter, it can be frustrating to be confronted with this kind of uncertainty. Especially when trying to decide what to do. In the case of global warming, a correct understanding of that issue is huge for determining appropriate public policy for entire nations. The truth is important.

Even though I have a degree in engineering, I don't feel like I was ever trained in how to effectively evaluate the current state of discovery on a particular scientific question. But I now think that it is critical to learn how to do so. One unfortunate quality of the internet is that an unfiltered search could land you in places full of pseudoscience and unfounded opinions trying to convince you of all kinds of things.

So as I proactively learn about the good work people out there are doing to objectively study how are world works, I'll share my discoveries and encourage people to share there own findings through personal experiments or peer-reviewed studies they've read.


# Politics

Kavanaugh………. For those of you that have been happily unaware of this issue, Brett Kavanaugh is the newest judge on the United States Supreme court as of October. His selection process comes across as having been the most controversial in the history of the supreme court, especially with the number of sexual assault allegations that came up while Congress was considering him. I saw people passionately promoting opposite views on the issue. 

What was enlightening for me was seeing how different sources of the news media covered the exact same event; the event being the confirmation hearing specifically dedicated to addressing the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh.

One source interprets Kavanaugh’s behavior during the hearing as aggressive, entitled, partisan, emotionally unstable, and dishonest. Someone who regardless of the truth of the allegations is not the kind of person that should be on the supreme court. The other source paints a picture of someone who showed great strength of resolve and heroism. A man who took the stand to defend himself and his family with fiery passion against hypocritical questioners.

This is just a single example of how who you listen to can have a significant impact on how you interpret real events in our country and thus shape your political position. Many recognize this and conclude that the only way to go about discovering the real truth is to read as many sources from all possible viewpoints and accepting that reality is probably somewhere in the middle. It’s increasingly evident how tribalism and political/ideological divisions paint the same event in different lights to support their own biases. Fake news, misleading information, and self-seeking agendas make it difficult to trust anything we hear.

It’s no wonder how social media comment sections become war zones of vitriol and broken relationships.

# Theology and Philosophy

I have been a Christian all of my life. I was born overseas to missionary parents and have always been involved in church, doing everything from taking care of children in the nursery to leading the congregation in worship. A right relationship with God is a core aspect of my life. 

The thing is that not everybody in traditional Christianity is in agreement on every belief and doctrine. There are various groups that take positions that are contradictory to each other. Growing up, I perceived that I could consider many of these groups to be fellow believers in core doctrine even if we differed from each other. I just gave them permission to be wrong on some points and excused the difference as ignorance or just cases of falling to a different conclusion on a point that was open to interpretation. For example, coming from a Charismatic background, I felt that a lot of Christians weren’t fully aware of the extent that the supernatural power of God could be a part of their lives and were just ignorant when claiming that it was only true for the founders of the church.

But once I seriously started looking into why different groups believe differently, the more I took a harder look at my own stance on things. I began to wonder where original Christianity fell on these issues. What do you do when you encounter doctrinal disagreements? Is reading the Bible alone enough to settle these matters? Do you need to rely on Church tradition to get to the truth? How did these books come together to form the Bible in the first place and what do you do when the church disagrees with mainstream conclusions of the scientific community when it comes to claims about the natural world?

The answers to these questions are important to me in that they shape what my world view and philosophy should be. 

# The BroWillow Mission

The sheer weight of all the questions I have in these three areas has gotten to the point where I absolutely need to spend time to explore and investigate these areas for myself in a more dedicated way. This vlog is my way of moving that effort forward. Here’s what we’re going to do:

In a time when public discourse seems more divisive and toxic than ever, I want to create a space where things are genuinely, critically, and respectfully discussed. Call me an optimist. I’ll talk about topics, conclusions, and questions that I’ve personally been thinking about in these areas: theology, philosophy, science, and politics.  I’ll always open the floor for discussion in the comment section to clarify my reasoning and give myself the opportunity to learn from the community. If someone changes my mind or reveals new information that sheds light on a certain topic, then I’ll make sure to address it in future videos.

If this channel can become a place where you can hear interesting things to think about…..where you feel like you can ask a question or disagree with me without feeling intimidated or in danger of ridicule…..where you can learn from the work I put in to study these topics…..and give feedback that is helpful to me and others.

...then I think that’s a place worth having.

At the start, you should expect a new BroWillow discussion every week at 6 AM Eastern on Monday morning. 

Overall, I am really excited to see what this next year has in store. If you want to stay up to date with what I am doing, like, follow, and subscribe my vlog on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and be on the look out for future videos to share and comment on. 

Thanks for watching. :)
