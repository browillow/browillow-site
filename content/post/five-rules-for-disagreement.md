# Introduction

On the BroWillow Vlog, I'm dedicating my time to honest discussions in theology, philosophy, science, and politics. Since these topics and our future discussions on them may end up being controversial, I want us to go ahead and prepare ourselves for disagreement so that we can go about it the right way. So here are the five rules we all should follow when faced with disagreement:

# Rule #1 - Stay Calm

This is the most important rule. It can be pretty easy to let your emotions rise when someone challenges something you care about or personally identify with. No matter how tempting it may be, don’t lose your cool.

Giving in to anger or offense can cloud your judgement and turn your thoughtful responses into reactions. Argument is one of the hardest modes of communication and unbridled emotion just adds an obstacle in the way of a successful discussion. Now if you see a person breaking this rule, you should calmly de-escalate the situation by steering the conversation in a better direction or bringing it to an early conclusion. If they aren’t thinking clearly then there’s not much point in continuing.

It’s okay to be a person of deep emotion. It’s okay to care about things. But if you’re the kind of person that lets your emotions control you, then you’re going to have a tough time with the rest of these rules.

# Rule #2 - Choose Your Battles

Deciding to engage in an argument is like deciding to go into battle. A good military commander knows that sometimes you should avoid a conflict instead of charging ahead every time you see the enemy. Engaging in an argument might not be appropriate if:

* **You're in a demilitarized zone.** A DMZ is an agreed upon geographic area free of military activity. Likewise, there are situations where there has been no invitation for argument and bringing one up would distasteful. Such as when someone is only trying to express themselves or when the points of disagreement are irrelevant to why you are interacting with them.
* **Casualties would be high.** The risk of damaging the other person or the relationship you have with them is too great to justify the conflict.
* **There’s not much reward.** When winning doesn’t actually benefit anyone much, is it worth arguing at all?
* **Better battles will come.** Sometimes it’s better to wait until a later time when it is more appropriate or you are better equipped.
* **It would be an unfair fight.** You know that the person you disagree with won’t engage in the argument in a productive way. They’ll get too emotional or fail to take you seriously.

On the flip side, many people don’t argue enough. They draw back from the idea of conflict. There are times when the right thing to do is be brave, hold your ground, and express yourself.

* You might be a situation where feedback is needed and even encouraged.
* The potential benefits of truth or making the right decisions outweigh the costs of argument.
* The people involved are capable of respectful and thoughtful discussion.

Some of you out there need to dare to disagree. Doing so can help someone become a better person, it can help your company be more successful, and it can even save lives. Check out the video description for a TED talk that gives an example of a woman who dared to disagree with the medical community and ended up saving children from cancer.

# Rule #3 - Don't Make It Personal

 Just because someone disagrees with you doesn’t mean that they are a terrible person or that they don’t like you. It doesn’t mean that they are an idiot or that they believe differently for no good reason. You need to remember that the other person is a fellow human being that should be treated with dignity. I believe that if we learned how to consistently have tough conversations without damaging our relationships with one another, then we would have a much better society. If you attack people for thinking differently than you do, then not only could you be hurting someone without good cause, you also make it much more difficult for them to engage in the conversation without getting their feelings involved.

 In a good argument, the people involved are not on trial, the ideas are. Keep the conversation focused on the opinions, reasons, and ideas that are being considered. It might be helpful to pretend that the person doesn’t actually believe what they are saying but are just doing their best to argue for their position. Students in debate clubs are forced to defend opposing positions all the time. If you focus on the person, then you are in danger of falling into the ad hominem fallacy, meaning that instead of addressing the argument itself, you discredit what they are saying because of who they are. I repeat. Ad hominem is a fallacy. Rejecting an argument only because it came out of a certain person’s mouth is not an acceptable answer.

 If you want to properly respond to an argument, then I strongly advise following Rule #4.

# Rule #4 - Build A Steel Man

One of the many mistakes one can make in an argument is known as strawmanning. Strawmanning refers to the situation where you defeat an argument that your opponent never made. You stood up a misrepresentation of your opponent’s argument to face something the was easier to attack, a “straw man”.

Here’s an example that’s relevant to today. Imagine you came to me and said, “Jordan…..black lives matter.” (Remember Rule #1. Stay calm.) And I turned around and said, “No….all lives matter.”

With that kind of response, I could be setting up a straw man. I could be thinking that what you really meant was “black lives matter more” or an even stricter statement, “only black lives matter”. Even though my response could be appropriate against those statements, it doesn’t change the fact that you didn’t say it. All you said was “black lives matter” and I might need to you to clarify what you mean before giving my response.

Creating a straw man doesn’t do much good at all except give you the illusion that you have the upper hand. It wastes time because now the other person has to defend the fact that they didn’t say something instead focusing on what they actually said. If you’re not careful, it gives the impression that you’re not listening and that winning (or the illusion of it) is more important to you than understanding.

A defence against strawmanning is doing the opposite: steelmanning. You intentionally try to form the best version of your opponent’s argument, ask your opponent if they agree with it, and then argue with that. Yes… you heard me right…..you help the argument you disagree with. You should try to do this as early in the conversation as possible. That means your first goal is to listen and gather the materials you need to build your steel man. By doing your best to help your opponent’s argument as much as possible, you’ll understand their position more clearly and you may discover that there wasn’t a disagreement to begin with. 

In our example, my initial response could be, “Do you mean, ‘black lives matter too’?” If you say yes, then I could simply say, “I agree”.

If you still disagree with the person after this exercise, at least they will know that you understand them and it’s more likely that they will listen to you. Another benefit of this practice is that by doing your very best to improve the case for the other side, you might actually find yourself persuaded.

And that leads us into Rule #5.

# Rule #5 - Keep An Open Mind

Are you prepared or even willing to be wrong? Do you even consider that to be a possibility? Whenever you don’t, you shut off your potential to learn something new and grow. You put up a wall that prevents you from sincerely considering what someone else has to say. Arguing with this kind of mindset means that you’re asking someone to do something that you yourself are not willing to do: listen and reconsider.

Absolute truth does exist. If something is really true then no amount of reconsideration will make it not true. I am completely convinced that two plus two absolutely equals four. I also know that I’m not perfect and that makes it possible for me to be mistaken about reality and to have ideas that aren’t the best. An unwillingness to personally subject those thoughts to judgement allows those mistakes and bad ideas to exist indefinitely.

So if you come up to me and say that two plus two actually equals five, then, as a matter of principle, I will ask you, “Why do you think that?”. And if you’re following the same rule of keeping an open mind and we discover that my sincere reconsideration in light of your argument fails to change what I think, then the ball has now come back to you to ask, “Why does Jordan still think that?”

# Conclusion

My intention for this vlog is to talk about important topics so that you can understand the questions I have, the conclusions I make, and why. There is a really good chance that at some point I will say something that seems wrong or in opposition to your views.  

I want this to happen! That’s what these videos are for….to face these topics head on and get closer to the truth together. I’m not perfect and can be wrong, so I’m relying on you to keep me in check. But I’m also hoping that what I say can challenge your current thinking and teach you something new along the way.
